<p>	El Salvador’s Civil war, officially taking place from 1979 to 1992, marked an overturning in a history of fraudulent elections and presidencies that had been prominent since the 1930s. Since El Salvador gained independence from Spanish rule in 1821, the wealthy (delineated from the Spanish) had been economically in control of El Salvador and in turn, had much governmental sway (Freedom Archives). This meant that until the Civil War, El Salvador was a pseudo-democratic nation, with a consistently growing leftist working class and bubbling revolutionary groups. In 1979, President Carlos Romero – a former military general and violent leader – was overthrown by the revolutionary group Revolutionary Government Junta, or the JRG (Knapp). Despite describing their intentions to maintain a “moderate, reformist civil-military coalition government,” the JRG proved to continue the pattern of military violence towards civilians in order to stop the spread of any left-wing or “Communist” ideas (White). The Carter administration financially backed the JRG, wanting to contribute to these anti-Communist goals. In 1980, members of the Salvadoran National Guard raped and killed four visiting American nuns, sparking outrage from U.S. citizens and pressure on Carter to pull back his support. The Archbishop of El Salvador had historically condemned the JRG, and openly criticized them during a sermon, for which he was shot by a JRG supporter. Anger spread through the Salvadoran people, and the leftist guerilla group Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) took to the mountains to plan a revolution (Knapp).</p>
 
<p>	As the war commenced, the Reagan administration took over and continued to fund the Salvadoran government, afraid that a potentially successful FMLN would lead El Salvador into a Communist model of government on par with Cuba. Violence was prevalent on both sides, though ultimately, innocent civilian deaths were more often caused by the JRG government than by the guerillas. So many Salvadorans were displaced that they were given temporary protected status in the U.S. – but not until the early 1990s. This proved to be too late as peace treaties for the Civil War were made in 1992. Most applications for protected status in the U.S. were denied during the first decade of the war (UC Davis Migration News). </p>

<p>	Many of the Salvadorans who fled to the U.S. during the 1980s were undocumented and therefore entered into a new manner of dangerous living. Some Salvadoran immigrants – displaced, discriminated, and poor – joined gangs and were eventually imprisoned, forcing their deportation due to the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (Knapp). Mass deportations of Salvadoran convicted criminals from the U.S. prison system to El Salvador led gang members to then recruit in El Salvador. The gang violence transferred over from the U.S. and became a foremost Salvadoran issue. In many cases, gangs back in their home country often held more power than the Salvadoran government, creating a huge rupture in civilian daily life. MS-13, among others, was one of the foremost gangs of this era (Adams and Pizarro).</p>

Bukele Cracks Down
--
<p> In 2019, President Nayib Bukele was elected, a milestone for El Salvador as he beat out the two dominating political parties (at this point, the FMLN had transitioned from a guerilla group to the central Salvadoran “left”). His platform framed the Salvadoran gang problem – the competing MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang groups – as one of terrorism. Under his authority, the Terrorism Confinement Center was built. The 40,000-capacity maximum security prison was filled with 69,000 gang members by May of 2023 (Rodriguez). This was enabled through a state of exception, a policy where citizens had to forfeit their right to due process and the government was enabled to make widespread arrests (Rojas).</p>

<p>Bukele’s swift exception policy inevitably sparked global controversy as it took away basic civil liberties. Anyone potentially associated with a gang could be locked up without trial indefinitely. However, daily Salvadoran life improved as people were no longer afraid to leave their houses at night or meander through the streets alone, and tourism in 2024 increased by 22%. Before then, tourism had been gradually introduced in the 1960s along with the establishment of the Salvadoran Institute of Tourism (ISTU) in 1961, and provided a moderate-at-best boost to the economy. This of course quickly turned for the worse less than two decades later with the start of the Salvadoran Civil War (Alfaro). However, due to multiple renewed tourism initiatives, especially more recent attempts to restore historic landmarks and improve infrastructure under Bukele’s administration, tourism is now considered one of the stabilizing factors of the Salvadoran economy. Visitors, mostly coming from the Global North, are attracted to the affordable beachy coasts and mountains, as well as the number of Mayan ruins that prove to be central to Salvadoran geographical character and identity (Patel, Clarín).</p>

Authentic Salvadoran Symbols 
--
<p>	The hanging decoration in my kitchen is similar – in the way it exists in this liminal space of being artisanal but also mass-produced – to items sold in the shops catering to these tourists. It is made up of nine pieces of thin wood and is held together by small metal loops. The top piece is distinct as it serves as a sort of header or artist’s introduction, laying out a series of historical and cultural symbols to preface the former national currency. The top piece is also larger and arched on the top, and is where the artisan took creative liberties.</p>
<p>	The arched top piece is printed and bordered with a fake wood grain and a green background. Within that, there is a colorful, outlined portion filled with tropical motifs – rainbow-colored plants, a butterfly, five different tropical birds (one toucan, three parrots, and one potential finch), and a rippling Salvadoran flag. On an ombre bubble on the right are the words “Rincón Mágico,” proudly referring to El Salvador as a “Magical Corner,” and on the bottom in rainbow block lettering it spells out “El Salvador.” Outside of the outlined tropical scene in the bottom left corner are two simple white buildings with red roofs. On the very top, also outside of the scene, is a rainbow banner that spells out “Lo Nuestro” in blue lettering. Below and to the right is a huge white dove with its wings outspread. Altogether, the artisan seems to weave a tapestry of images that to foreigners, appear to be generally tropical and idealized, but to a Salvadoran, actually serve as symbols of national identity.</p>
 
<p>	The choice of symbols used to introduce the following colónes feels generic, almost as if the artist chose out of a random hat of tropical motifs. This is one possible interpretation, as the process of tropicalization is often one that markets well to a white audience. Tropicalization is often something that happens to Latinas in popular media in order to create sexual appeal through the strong visuals of an “exotic” look (Martynuska). This process, however, can generally be applied to anything that needs to be marketed to an audience outside of Latinos who have a limited idea of how Latin countries operate outside of what the media tells them. Tropicalization is marketing, and marketing is what sells.</p>
 
<p>	Following this line of reasoning, several symbols on my decoration may not be “authentically” Salvadoran. Authenticity, in this case, is meant to refer to “genuineness or realness of [artifacts] or events…or being true to one’s essential nature” (Rickly et al.). In other words, to what extent the symbols chosen represent the essence of El Salvador. The toucan, parrots, and vaguely tropical plants, for instance, are not chiefly “Salvadoran” features. These symbols could be attributed to almost any warm-climate country in Latin America and feel generic – an item to bring home to prove one is well-traveled and brought back something unique from a nice vacation.</p>

<p>	On the other hand, some of the symbols do speak to Salvadoran authenticity and essence. One of the birds that looks like a finch, for instance, is the Salvadoran national bird – the torogoz, or turquoise-browed motmot. The torogoz actually distances itself from notions of tropicalization, as it mostly lives in the forest or shrubland (Redlist). Furthermore, torogoces have historically been a symbol of Salvadoran nationalism and independence. Los Torogoces de Morazán was actually a guerilla musical group associated with the FMLN that traveled through El Salvador and performed intending to be a “weapon of war,” and expose the truth of U.S. involvement and Salvadoran government tyranny during the height of the Civil War in the eighties . The musicians even called themselves “the musical expression of the Salvadoran revolution” (Azahar).</p>

<p>	Another surprisingly authentic symbol is the little white houses with red roofs, which actually represent a typical house in a Salvadoran rural neighborhood or pueblo. Since 2019, El Salvador has focused tourism efforts on rural areas, especially to attract Europeans. The idea of these efforts is to market these areas as “pueblos vivos,” or living towns that are several kilometers away from city centers. The pueblos vivos notion intends to economically invigorate poorer areas that boast “strong indigenous roots, typical gastronomy, crafts made with natural fibers, as well as its religious celebrations” (Fernandez). The little white houses with red roofs are thus able to conjure up images of an El Salvador that was closer to its peasant, indigenous roots, while still serving to present a marketable image to tourists.</p>
