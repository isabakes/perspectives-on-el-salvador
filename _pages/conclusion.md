*My husband meeting his brother in El Salvador for the first time.*

<p>Despite a plethora of concerns that remain within El Salvador’s political sphere, the past several years have proven to be empowering for the Salvadoran diaspora, and most promising for immigrants longing to reconnect with friends and family at home. Many of the immigrants, like my own family, who exited during the height of gang violence are now able to relive a portion of the peaceful life they may remember, where they were able to escape from the violent political and economic turmoil and exist “authentically.” Reminders of this escape exist on kitchen and living room walls – communal spaces – to remind them of their complex roots, as well as their historical and religious identifiers.</p>

<p>Such decorations, such artifacts, hold within them a mythos of a culture. In the same way that history repeats itself, culture evolves while holding fast to recurring narratives. El Salvador started as an indigenous land, then it was colonized and turned into a Spanish land, rebranded as a land of “mestizos,” and now, reverts to its indigeneity. Within the uniformity of a mass-production exterior lies a unique identity enforcement and reinforcement, which gives agency to its maker, and harkens back to notions of artisans and, again, an indigenous subsistence economy. The maker, in this case, seems to acknowledge the very elements of Salvadoran Latinidad – the quality and daily experience of being Latino/a/x – which require colonialism as part of the making of culture today. Without a colonial presence, El Salvador and its people would be very different today. For better or worse, Columbus’s fourth voyage allowed for the development of key Salvadoran characteristics – like speaking Spanish and practicing Catholicism – as well as the monetary ability to support tourism, and thus the chance to grow rural economies and (ironically) renew pride in more indigenous areas and traditions. </p>

<p>However, acknowledging a colonial legacy does not equate to condoning or embracing it. Columbus’s place on the front of the Salvadoran bill no longer completely matters in history books – that era is quite literally defunct. New powers are at play, and new tensions are working head-to-head against each other. On one end: a “popular dictator” and the end of several decades of terrorism; on the other: a potential future of revised democracy, which skews traditional human rights in favor of a perceived greater good.</p>
