<h2 style="text-align:center;">Adorning Ideologies: Salvadoran-American Anecdotes and Lived Realities</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Nationalism Hung in the Home</h3>

<p>Finding online proof that my colón decoration was not unique, and similar items are being sold in Salvadoran markets – was virtually impossible. Most Salvadoran markets are nearly identical – there are the food stalls, the clothing stalls, the technology stalls, etc. Most businesses deal in cash and don’t necessarily have an online presence or storefront. As such, there are very limited pictures online of such markets – most pictures are shared via tourist blogs, TripAdvisor, or Salvadoran journalists sharing examples of places you can go for various “authentic” goods.</p>

<p>However, I was able to find a very similar wooden decoration of printed colónes in the background of a photo of an artisanal stand of painted metal lanterns. The decoration hangs in the left on one rectangular square, with the bills printed on the left and right edges, and Salvadoran vistas and symbols (including the Salvadoran government seal) plastered right in the middle. The visual sense of nationalism echoes even more so on this decoration than on mine as it is lumped in a much smaller surface area. The seal jumps out from the picture, adding a sense of national approval (from a beloved Bukele, perhaps) to this declaration of Salvadoran pride. Through this, I was able to confirm that this renewed nationalism is also evident in Salvadoran locals themselves, as well as in those who left (but still hold space) for their origins. In the following section, I explore my own family’s decoration “archive,” to analyze which symbols they chose to exhibit national pride and identity, and “adorn” their “ideology.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Abuela and Catholicism</h3>

<p>In my grandmother-in-law’s living room hangs a decoration with different rhetoric, but similar feel, to the colón decoration. The jar-shaped wooden piece contains utility on multiple fronts: two hooks, to hang keys from, and a printed bible passage from Psalm 91. Over top there is a command, telling the reader to “forget everything but God.” On top of this, there is a small but clear connector of this religious reminder to identity – “El Salvador.” In other words, to be a good Salvadoran, one must maintain the faith. Psalm 91 is a cry out to God, asking him to be the speaker’s refuge and shelter. There is a promise of safety and protection when submitting to a higher authority. </p>

<p>My Abuela is a strong Catholic, but she’s also an immigrant who left during the 1990s, at the height of gang violence in her village of Zacatecoluca. This biblical decoration serves to reinforce her Catholic identity, carried from her ethnic roots, while also being an appropriate reminder that she is being taken care of after years of fear of danger and uncertainty about her country’s future. There is no symbolic credit given to a strictly Salvadoran power, like the image of Bukele my mother-in-law exalts that will be discussed soon. Abuela’s decoration seems to credit God as her “salvador” – her Savior. She is proud to be Salvadoran; she is proud to be Catholic; she is proud to be protected by her version of government – the monarchy of the king of heaven. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Mama H. and Bukele</h3>

<p>Bukele’s anti-terrorism efforts, if controversial, have made him extremely popular with Salvadorans and Salvadoran-Americans alike. His “war on gangs” have been documented by human rights organizations as continually undemocratic, as there is evidence of torture and mass unwarranted arrests that all come with his extended state of exception. Regardless, the proof is in the pudding: “any reservations that voters have about such actions – or a lackluster economy – are for now outweighed by the perception of security and progress: of a new El Salvador” (Graham). Lack of due process seems a fair price to pay to walk without fear on the streets. </p>

<p>A prominent hanging decoration of Bukele hangs in my mother-in-law’s kitchen, also to hang keys. It is blue and white (the Salvadoran colors), and depicts the torogoz, the Salvadoran government seal, flor de izote (the national Salvadoran flower), and fresh Salvadoran coffee beans. Next to Bukele – who looks slick and authoritative with microphone in hand – are the words “The president that’s making history.” As he is surrounded by items that have officially been recognized as representative of El Salvador, Bukele is credited with being the perfect Salvadoran leader, or a man who truly represents the people and what they stand for, implicitly in comparison to their history of ineffective leaders (who didn’t make history). My mother-in-law is one of the many who would have gladly voted for Bukele if she had stayed in her home country. Whenever she speaks of the “good” he’s done, her eyes twinkle and she clasps her hands together in a stance of admiration. Bukele, to her, is her “Salvador,” or her Savior, who seems to mend her painful memories of the violent home she left behind and gives her hope for the future of her people. To her, pride in what the government can do for its people sets the foundation for her pride in her identity.</p>
